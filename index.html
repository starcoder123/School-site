        Hi! My name is Andromeda Galaxy, but you can call me Mr. Galaxy. I am the principal of Streamline middle school. We cover the whole semester on children's education, and plus, we give good breaks! There are breaks between classes and they are each 15 minutes. School ends at 3:00 pm Pacific Time. Many kids love this school, and the teachers are super nice. We have field games every day at the end of school, and we respect and value the kids equally. There is a huge planâ€¦ it's a pretty big school! And we love our breaks. I hope you like our school!

        This school has a lot of floor plan. The campus has a huge playground, with enough yard duties. We have a blacktop, with basketball hoops and baseball bases and jump ropes, and hula hoops, etc. We have a soccer field, too. There is a grass field where we can do some field games. But I recommend you DON'T pull the grass. There is a supply list. Click the button to see it.

    <h5>
        As you all know, my name is Andromeda Galaxy. I love to draw, I hate math, but I love school. Some of my fav subjects are Art, Reading, Science, Writing, and Music. Since I love school, I thought, "Well, if I love school so much, why don't I be a principal?". So that's how I got my job. Since then, I loved my job, interacting with the kids, talking to teachers, and just spreading smiles with my funny jokes. I make silly announcements, too, that don't offend people, and is mild humour. I highly discourage bullying and I want to make all kids feel welcome, like they're all part of our large family.
